# Love, actually
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

This is a satirical take on the "love, actually" activity. In this simulation, the user controls a clown emoji that moves around trying to collect money,there are also "fish" (clowns with lipstick) following him around while keeping a set distance, as the user collects more money the fish get closer to the user. The game ends if the user makes contact with a fish or if the user collects a set amount of money.
