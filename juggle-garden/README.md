# Juggle garden
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

This is a remake of the classic game "pong", this variation has a clown instead of a ball and some extra mechanics. Each player controls a paddle with keys & accelerations. The 2 player game counts the round scores and wins for each player (games are best of 3). The exercise mainly explores having a simulation as an object/instance, which I believe could facilitate having multiple simulations/games run in the same script
