        My answer to this week's reading question is:<br> <br>
        If I was able to travel back to the 1970's, I would not affect anything until 1974 except for creating spam
        e-mails as soon as 1972, so Ray Tomlinson starts thinking about a way to block them. I would lie to the
        Department of Defense and tell them that if ARPA spam e-mails didn't become a thing of the past, they would end
        up
        provoking a nuclear war (to take advantage of the cold war paranoia and get that sweet funding). Considering the
        Network would be heavily underused at the time (~2% of its capacity), we could assign as many researchers and
        resources as possible to exterminate spam mail. I would like to make sure that TCP/IP is still developed the
        same way as it was, I'd give Mr. Kahn and a high five and tell him he's doing a great job. After the end of
        TCP/IP
        development, I would try to accelerate its adoption and implementation. I would also convince the Department of
        Defense to divert a portion of its funding into the people developing Unix, Usenet and CSNET to make
        the foundations of the Internet stronger and more mature. Finally, another important person to which I would
        divert funding would be Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, in the hopes of helping Linux become
        even better than it is today, considering its importance in the modern world. It is difficult to credit the
        creation of the internet to a single or few persons, history seems to show that the internet was a result
        of decades of contributions from all types of groups and people. The government, regular people, students,
        scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, and the U.S government all played different but critical roles (in the
        cold war context)
        in creating the internet as we know it today.

        My answer to this week's reading question is:<br> <br>
        If the North Turtle government needed my help taking back our independence and control over its internet and
        existing infrastructure, I would start by taking back the infrastructure, hurting outsiders' facility to
        monopolize our internet, and progressively regain control of it. I would begin by putting Omnicorp's
        infrastructure in the hands of the government, checking any storage drive for valuable data, and allowing the
        construction of a national network. I would start implementing heavy taxes to outsider tech companies to help
        them fund our independence and a secret program to reverse engineer modern hardware and software. For any places
        missing internet access, I would encourage and contribute to a relay approach like the works of the Detroit
        Community Technology project, continuing the existing infrastructure, unlike the US, I would encourage and even
        fund citizens with good projects to share the network and its expansion. The money collected from web companies
        would also help fund their new local competitors. A viable economical strategy to make software/web development
        a pivotal part of the economy would be developed and implemented, as it could potentially allow for great return
        on the limited investment and resources of the new country. Building our own servers would be a top priority
        from the beginning, as it would allow the country to better protect its assets, money, banks, and other crucial
        data, without North Turtlers being at the mercy of whoever hosts all the data.
