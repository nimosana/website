            If I was able to travel back to the 1970's, I would not affect anything until 1974 except for creating spam
            e-mails as soon as 1972, so Ray Tomlinson starts thinking about a way to block them. I would lie to the
            Department of Defense and tell them that if ARPA spam e-mails didn't become a thing of the past, they would
            end up provoking a nuclear war (to take advantage of the cold war paranoia and get that sweet funding).
            Considering the Network would be heavily underused at the time (~2% of its capacity), we could assign as
            many researchers and resources as possible to exterminate spam mail. I would like to make sure that TCP/IP
            is still developed the same way as it was, I'd give Mr. Kahn and a high five and tell him he's doing a great
            job. After the end of TCP/IP development, I would try to accelerate its adoption and implementation. I would
            also convince the Department of Defense to divert a portion of its funding into the people developing Unix,
            Usenet and CSNET to make the foundations of the Internet stronger and more mature. Finally, another
            important person to which I would divert funding would be Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation,
            in the hopes of helping Linux become even better than it is today, considering its importance in the modern
            world. It is difficult to credit the creation of the internet to a single or few persons, <em
                class="em2">history seems to show that the internet was a result of decades of contributions from all
                types of groups and people </em>. The government, regular people, students, scientists, politicians,
            bureaucrats, and the U.S government all played different but critical roles (in the cold war context) in
            creating the internet as we know it today.

            If the North Turtle government needed my help taking back our independence and control over its internet
            and existing infrastructure, I would start by taking back the infrastructure, hurting outsiders' facility to
            monopolize our internet, and progressively regain control of it. I would begin by putting Omnicorp's
            infrastructure in the hands of the government, checking any storage drive for valuable data, and
            allowing the construction of a national network. I would start implementing heavy taxes to outsider tech
            companies to help them fund our independence and a secret program to reverse engineer modern hardware and
            software. For any places missing internet access, I would encourage and contribute to a relay approach like
            the works of the Detroit Community Technology project, continuing the existing infrastructure, unlike the
            US, I would encourage and even fund citizens with good projects to share the network and its expansion. The
            money collected from web companies would also help fund their new local competitors. A viable economical
            strategy to make software/web development a pivotal part of the economy would be developed and implemented,
            as it could potentially allow for great return on the limited investment and resources of the new country.
            <em class="em3">Building our own servers would be a top priority from the beginning, as it would allow the
                country to better protect its assets, money, banks, and other crucial data</em>, without North Turtlers
            being at the mercy of whoever hosts all the data.

            In my opinion, early internet artists were probably inspired and motivated by the sense of community and
            closeness between the users. I believe the motivation was not usually economic but rather the ability to
            show everyone what was possible to do. Considering most of the netizens were building their own websites,
            this design or creation process of early websites allowed for the internet to be a more expressive
            environment. <em class="em4">I would define a successful artist as a person with the ability to create works
                that are thought provoking and or groundbreaking, bringing something new and influential for future
                creators.</em> I was particularly impressed by <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/"
                class="week4">Olia's “war”</a> because I immediately found it very thought provoking in the sense that
            it presents its content/story in a very distinctive and well thought manner, using what is now relatively
            simple code (links, images, color changes, and a grid view). I can't help myself but imagine how influential
            the sight of that website would've been for me if I was in the 90's making my own websites, especially if I
            hadn't seen anything similar. I also believe that Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans were successful because
            they showcased various interesting and original ways of displaying websites. <em class="em4"> In a way, <a
                    href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/" class="week4">jodi.org</a> could be seen as a pillar of abstract
                website design.</em>

            If I were hired at Concordia in 2030 to teach this course, in addition to having group reflections based on
            the readings, I would have students experiment with different generations of computers at the start of each
            class. Starting with the giant computers used in the early ARPANET, slowly progressing up to contemporary
            systems. I would have them test key innovations such as <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rKUf9DWRI" class="week5">the interactive technologies presented
                by Doug Engelbart in 1968</a>, while discussing the ideas that emerged from them and would later
            materialize or not (such as <a href="https://hybrid.concordia.ca/jdesplan/readings/nelson_excerpt.pdf"
                class="week5">Ted Nelson's philosophy</a> about hyperlinks and the usage of personal computers). The
            idea would be to show how technologies took certain paths and would sometimes change knowing better
            alternatives could've been implemented earlier. The objective would be to ensure students are conscientious
            about the mistakes made along the way, while incentivizing reflection about the current state of affairs and
            be critical about the path that is currently being taken, and its implications for the future. <em
                class="em5">As a well-known Spanish saying goes: “Quién no conoce su historia está condenado a
                repetirla”</em> (He who does not know his history is condemned to repeat it), I believe it is crucial
            for the generations that will continue shaping these technologies to learn from mistakes made in the past to
            help pave a better path towards the future.

            If I was responsible for establishing a lucrative agreement between Omnicorp and Conkers University. I would
            produce a multiple step plan to make Omnicorp profit from the Software innovations of Conkers University.
            The first step would use part of the budget to create a division specializing in offering various services
            related to the software innovations from Conkers. Contracts for the creation of more specialized derived
            programs from private clients or modern “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/"
                class="week6">Kickstarter</a>” style community funded projects, teaching services on how to use, modify
            or maintain these programs could also be provided (<em class="em6">inspired by Richard Stallman's</em> <a
                href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html" class="week6">GNU Manifesto)</a>. The second step would be
            to annually use parts of the funds and the return on investment to create a relationship with Conkers, being
            a sponsor to their research, giving grants and scholarships. In exchange the university would create
            programs where the students can do internships at Omnicorp, and having the company promoted as a future job
            opportunity in the division created in step one. This relationship would benefit both Conkers and Omnicorp,
            Conkers would have a reliable sponsor and Omnicorp would have an employment pool and internship students
            knowledgeable about the software innovations. The institutions could also have a deal where Omnicorp
            employees help in the development of Conkers' software innovations, giving Omnicorp an edge on the
            competition <em class="em6">(especially before/at the public launch of these innovations).</em>

            If I was a software technician at the research lab where the COVID-28 vaccine was being developed and
            researchers were raising concerns about the accessibility of the research made, I would tell them about
            their legal or illegal possibilities. I would suggest raising the concerns to the company and university, or
            even protest. I would talk about how it's possible for anyone with access to the data to leak it, but also
            the implications of this action.<em class="em7"> I would personally never leak any private information,</em>
            not because I support corporate greed or believe it's wrong.<em class="em7"> I would never because it's
                illegal, people around me know how much I care about following the rules!</em> Anyways even if I did
            something like this, I'd make sure nobody would know who it was and certainly wouldn't admit it on my
            website. I
            don't care about becoming a hero or not, if someone leaked private data and I knew who, best believe
            I wouldn't say a word about it. I'd rather live a normal life and use my knowledge to write (legal) programs
            that help humanity, without rotting in jail or getting suicided. Reading Sherry Tuckle's excerpt “<a

            (way too much), It definitely distanced myself in all my interpersonal relationships, including those that
            matter most to me. I love my computer and romantic relationships are just a waste of time anyways, I
            should've applied at MIT and become a hacker. At this point I just hope the knowledge I've been accumulating
            will not go to
            waste.

            incentive to tell anyone, however I wouldn't like knowing about it and not saying anything. I wouldn't run
            to the director's office and scream injustice, but I would help my female coworkers “<a class="week8"
                id="week8Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwKjGbz60k">put the glasses on</a>” hoping they do
            something about it. , I would reunite an initial group of coworkers (male & female) that I trust, tell them
            what I've learnt & see if they want to do something about it, I would also offer to collaborate preparing
            good proof (without the private document). If my coworkers decided not to do anything about their unjust
            reality, it would definitely annoy me but at that point it's not my problem. I've always been someone that's
            critical and not scared to talk about things or ideas I disagree with, trying to ponder potential solutions.
            Sadly, I feel like even when there's something people disagree with, most never actually do anything about
            it.
