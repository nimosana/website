        Welcome to my website
    </h1>
    <p>
        My answer to this week's reading question is:<br> <br>
        If I was able to travel back to the 1970’s, I would not affect anything until 1974 except for creating spam
        e-mails as soon as 1972, so Ray Tomlinson starts thinking about a way to block them. I would lie to the
        Department of Defense and tell them that if spam e-mails didn’t become a thing of the past, they would end up
        provoking a nuclear war (to take advantage of the cold war paranoia and get that sweet funding). Considering the
        Network would be heavily underused at the time (~2% of its capacity), we could assign as many researchers and
        resources as possible to exterminate spam mail. I would like to make sure that TCP/IP is still developed the
        same way as it was, I’d go give Mr. Kahn a high five and tell him he’s doing a great job. After TCP/IP
        development, I would try to accelerate its adoption and implementation. I would also convince the Department of
        Defense to divert a portion of its funding into the people developing Unix and Usenet (and later CSNET) to make
        the foundations of the Internet stronger and more mature. Finally, another important person to which I would
        divert funding would be Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, in the hopes of helping Linux become
        even better than it is today, considering its importance in the modern world. It is difficult to credit the
        creation of the internet to a single or few people, history seems to clearly show that the internet was a result
        of decades of contributions from different groups and people. The government, regular people, students,
        scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, and the U.S government all played critical roles (in the cold war context)
        in what became the internet as we know it today.
