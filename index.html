            If I was able to travel back to the 1970's, I would not affect anything until 1974 except for creating spam
            e-mails as soon as 1972, so Ray Tomlinson starts thinking about a way to block them. I would lie to the
            Department of Defense and tell them that if ARPA spam e-mails didn't become a thing of the past, they would
            end up provoking a nuclear war (to take advantage of the cold war paranoia and get that sweet funding).
            Considering the Network would be heavily underused at the time (~2% of its capacity), we could assign as
            many researchers and resources as possible to exterminate spam mail. I would like to make sure that TCP/IP
            is still developed the same way as it was, I'd give Mr. Kahn and a high five and tell him he's doing a great
            job. After the end of TCP/IP development, I would try to accelerate its adoption and implementation. I would
            also convince the Department of Defense to divert a portion of its funding into the people developing Unix,
            Usenet and CSNET to make the foundations of the Internet stronger and more mature. Finally, another
            important person to which I would divert funding would be Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation,
            in the hopes of helping Linux become even better than it is today, considering its importance in the modern
            world. It is difficult to credit the creation of the internet to a single or few persons, <em2>history seems
                to show that the internet was a result of decades of contributions from all types of groups and people
            </em2>. The government, regular people, students, scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, and the U.S
            government all played different but critical roles (in the cold war context) in creating the internet as we
            know it today.

            <em>My answer to this week's reading question is:</em><br> <br>
            If the North Turtle government needed my help taking back our independence and control over its internet and
            existing infrastructure, I would start by taking back the infrastructure, hurting outsiders' facility to
            monopolize our internet, and progressively regain control of it. I would begin by putting Omnicorp's
            infrastructure in the hands of the government, checking any storage drive for valuable data, and allowing
            the construction of a national network. I would start implementing heavy taxes to outsider tech companies to
            help them fund our independence and a secret program to reverse engineer modern hardware and software. For
            any places missing internet access, I would encourage and contribute to a relay approach like the works
            of the Detroit Community Technology project, continuing the existing infrastructure, unlike the US,
            I would encourage and even fund citizens with good projects to share the network and its expansion. The
            money collected from web companies would also help fund their new local competitors. A viable economical
            strategy to make software/web development a pivotal part of the economy would be developed and implemented,
            as it could potentially allow for great return on the limited investment and resources of the new country.
            <em>Building our own servers would be a top priority from the beginning, as it would allow the country to
                better protect its assets, money, banks, and other crucial data</em>, without North Turtlers being at
            the mercy of whoever hosts all the data.

            In my opinion, early internet artists were probably inspired and motivated by the sense of community and
            closeness between the users. I believe the motivation was not usually economic but rather the ability to
            show everyone what was possible to do. Considering most of the netizens were building their own websites,
            this design or creation process of early websites allowed for the internet to be a more expressive
            environment. <em class="em3">I would define a successful artist as a person with the ability to create works
                that are thought provoking and or groundbreaking, bringing something new and influential for
                future creators.</em> I was particularly impressed by <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/">Olia's
                “war”</a> because I immediately found it very thought provoking in the sense that it presents its
            content/story in a very distinctive and well thought manner, using what is now relatively simple code
            (links, images, color changes, and a grid view). I can't help myself but imagine how influential the sight
            of that website would've been for me if I was in the 90's making my own websites, especially if I hadn't
            seen anything similar. I also believe that Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans were successful because they
            showcased various interesting and original ways of displaying websites. <em class="em3"> In a way, <a
                    href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/">jodi.org</a> could be seen as a pillar of abstract website
                design.</em>

            If I were hired at Concordia in 2030 to teach this course, in addition to having group reflections based on
            the readings, I would have students experiment with different generations of computers at the start of each
            class. Starting with the giant computers used in the early ARPANET, slowly progressing up to contemporary
            systems. I would have them test key innovations such as <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rKUf9DWRI" class="week4">the interactive technologies presented
                by Doug Engelbart in 1968</a>, while discussing the ideas that emerged from them and would later
            materialize or not (such as <a href="https://hybrid.concordia.ca/jdesplan/readings/nelson_excerpt.pdf"
                class="week4">Ted Nelson's philosophy</a> about hyperlinks and the usage of personal computers). The
            idea would be to show how technologies took certain paths and would sometimes change knowing better
            alternatives could've been implemented earlier. The objective would be to ensure students are conscientious
            about the mistakes made along the way, while incentivizing reflection about the current state of affairs and
            be critical about the path that is currently being taken, and its implications for the future. <em
                class="em4">As a well-known Spanish saying goes: “Quién no conoce su historia está condenado a
                repetirla”</em> (He who does not know his history is condemned to repeat it), I believe it is crucial
            for the generations that will continue shaping these technologies to learn from mistakes made in the past to
            help pave a better path towards the future.
