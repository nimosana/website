# Dodge em!
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria
Exercise : dodge-em!

For this exercise, I took the original code from the catching covid-19 activity and built on it. The idea of the program is that the player controls his character with the mouse, the character follows the mouse and the virus follows the character. The player has to "grab" as many syringes as he can, which gives him a vaccination (score) and moves the syringe to a random location. When the user is touched by the virus, the screen goes black and syringes start appearing randomly for every vaccination the user had, after displaying all the syringes the user is then clowned and told he died no matter the number of vaccinations he had.

The virus image was generated using OpenAI's DALL-E.
